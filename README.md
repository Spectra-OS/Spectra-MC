# Spectra Microconsen kernel
This is a Spectra modified version of the Microconsen kernel in Bambus OS, which is set to be used in later versions.
It is based on the 53xx releases of the kernel.

The original version was developed by BambusOS (@bambus-os / @bambus80 on GitHub) and released under MIT license.
The subsequent modified kernel versions and Spectra releases will also fall into this license.
